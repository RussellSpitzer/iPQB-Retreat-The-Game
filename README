 = Installation Instructions =
 =============================
 1. Insert the first (out of 17) installation disks into your computer's 5.25" floppy drive.
 2. When the blue system-error screen appears, hold down ctrl-shift-F11, while spinning your mouse anti-clockwise. 
 3. It is critically important that you not breathe while carrying out step 2.
 4. If done correctly, you will pass out.
 5. When you regain consciousness, the installation disks will have inexplicably vanished, but the game will be on your computer.
 Enjoy!
